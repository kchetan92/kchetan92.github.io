        <p class="read">In the summer of 2018, I worked with an amazing team of UX Designers, Researchers and Product Managers at Gale, Cengage. Our goal was to explore and design additional features for Digital Scholar Lab, a tool to cater the needs of Digital Humanities Researchers. I loved working on this project, because of the unique challenges it presented. The product was in beta, and I had to work within the existing design and technical constraints. The team was experienced and supportive. Frequent interactions with the product manager helped me develop a business and development perspective of the product, which helped me make informed design decisions.</p>

GALE has an impressive collection of ancient archives which are used by humanities researchers from various educational institutes. Some of these researchers use text mining and other computational methods to gain interesting insights.</p>

The final aim of the transcription feature is to produce text which can be used for data analysis. There can be other ways to do this as well. GALE uses one of the best Optical Character Recognition software, however the latest machine learning algorithms by Google and Microsoft do a much better job at converting images to text.</p>

The primary UX Researcher and some designers then work to convert the facts into personas. The details in the persona was fairly mini1mal, to allow for greater flexibility. The personas were then reviewed by other designers.</p>
