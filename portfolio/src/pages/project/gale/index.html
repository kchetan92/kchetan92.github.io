        <p class="read">In the summer of 2018, I worked with an amazing team of UX Designers, Researchers and Product Managers at Gale, Cengage. Our goal was to explore and design additional features for Digital Scholar Lab, a tool to cater the needs of Digital Humanities Researchers. I loved working on this project, because of the unique challenges it presented. The product was in beta, and I had to work within the existing design and technical constraints. The team was experienced and supportive. Frequent interactions with the product manager helped me develop a business and development perspective of the product, which helped me make informed design decisions.</p>

                With the research findings, I came up with some concepts which could be used to address various opportunities. I came up with a new method to validate my ideas. Since the UX team had been working on DSLAB for a while, they had a fair idea of the users’ needs and wants. Piggybacking on this secondary experience, I made concept cards and discussed them with the team. This process allowed me to combine improve and shortlist the ideas.
