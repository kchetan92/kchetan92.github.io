        <p class="read">In the summer of 2018, I worked with an amazing team of UX Designers, Researchers and Product Managers at Gale, Cengage. Our goal was to explore and design additional features for Digital Scholar Lab, a tool to cater the needs of Digital Humanities Researchers. I loved working on this project, because of the unique challenges it presented. The product was in beta, and I had to work within the existing design and technical constraints. The team was experienced and supportive. Frequent interactions with the product manager helped me develop a business and development perspective of the product, which helped me make informed design decisions.</p>

        <p class="read">Digital Humanities is a new interdisciplinary field of research which involves humanities and computing. GALE has an impressive collection of ancient archives which are used by humanities researchers from various educational institutes. Some of these researchers use text mining and other computational methods to gain interesting insights.</p>
        
        <p class="read">DSLAB aims to provide some basic computational tools for the researchers and also help them clean the transcribed text and collaborate with other researchers.</p>

        <p class="read">When I first started working on the project, I questioned the purpose of the transcription editor. The final aim of the transcription feature is to produce text which can be used for data analysis. There can be other ways to do this as well. GALE uses one of the best Optical Character Recognition software, however the latest machine learning algorithms by Google and Microsoft do a much better job at converting images to text.</p>

      <div class="large-8 large-offset-2 cell">
        <p class="read">Zooniverse is a place for untrained users to learn and contribute to current research projects. I appreciate the thorough on boarding process in these projects and interactive text entry tool which helps mark the region on the page as well.</p>
        <p class="read">Typewright is an online portal which transcribes 18th century texts with the help of volunteers. Typewright automatically identifies lines and juxtaposes the image and the text entry box. This makes it easy to concentrate on the text.</p>
        <p class="read">Some popular transcription tools have been made to address similar problems in the past. Some techniques may be adapted to suit for our needs.</p>

      <div class="large-8 large-offset-2 cell">
        <p class="read">Since the product was already in development stage, the team had developed some personas to define the target user of the product. I often referred to these personas to make design decisions. Six personas were short listed and were divided into 3 categories based on how important they were considered for the product.</p>

        <h3>INTERVIEWS</h3>
        <h2 class="name">Understanding the current trends and challenges</h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class="large-8 large-offset-2 cell">
        <p class="read">Digital humanities is a fairly new and diverse field. There are no rigid practices and conventions. To understand the current practices, I interviewed some researchers to learn how they work. Since the primary persona is not an expert researcher, I interviewed some novice users as well.</p>
        
        <p class="read">I developed an interview protocol to help me think through the questions I wanted to ask. But based on previous experience, I decided not to carry a detailed interview protocol with myself. It would’ve distracted me from the interview process itself otherwise.</p>
        
        <p class="read">
          The people I interviewed were:
          - Postdoctoral fellow for Chinese Studies. (expert)
          - PhD candidate working on DH projects. (novice)
          - Admin of a Transcription subreddit. (novice)
          - In house DH specialists. (expert)</p>
          
          <p class="read">Learning</p>
          <p class="read">DH Researchers can devote time to learn programming for their research. They often consult online programming courses.</p>
          <p class="read">“You know, the vast majority of the time and effort goes into assembling and preparing your data, the actual analytical part can be very, very fast”</p>
          
          <p class="read">
            OCR software cannot be used in all the cases. They do not work well with older text or different languages.</p>
            
            <p class="read">DH researchers annotate the titles, image descriptions and other meta data.</p>
            <p class="read">Page numbers are often associated with the transcription details, in case they’d want to refer to the original text.</p>
            <p class="read">Transcribed text is passed between the researchers as emails or via USB. Collaboration tools are required.
