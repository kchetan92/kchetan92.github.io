        <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
        <h2>Communication gap between the tenants, owners and the Water Department</h2>
        <p class="read">Every year thousands of student move in and out of the City of Ann Arbor, a college town home to the University of Michigan. Many students opt to rent Individual houses in Ann Arbor across the city. To offload the responsibility of paying water bills and dealing with overdue bills, the owners ask the tenants to take the ownership of the water connection. Which seems reasonable but miscommunication ensues. Tenants end up paying <b>fines</b> and have to <b>wait</b> for the water connection to be activated.</p>
