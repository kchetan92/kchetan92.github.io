        <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
        <h2>When athletes get injured</h2>
        <p class="read">Daily practice, demanding training routine and interacting with fellow teammates and coach is an essential part of an athletes' social life. But when they get injured, they are unable to participate in these activities. Common symptoms include depression, loss of identity and isolation. The rehabilitation process is slow and frustrating.</p>
        <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <p class="read">The team had a rich background in psychology and thanks to their expertise we were able to assimilate a good number of popular literature available on the psychological well being of injured athletes. Initial survey also included some interviews with friends of the team members who have been through similar ordeal.</p>
        <h2>Survey</h2>

            Based on what we had discovered so far, we designed a survey to validate our assumptions and gain useful insights. We contacted multiple athlete groups in the University of Michigan to participate in the online survey on Surveycake.
