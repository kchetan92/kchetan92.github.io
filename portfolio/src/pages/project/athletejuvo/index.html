        <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
        <h2>When athletes get injured</h2>
        <p class="read">Daily practice, demanding training routine and interacting with fellow teammates and coach is an essential part of an athletes' social life. But when they get injured, they are unable to participate in these activities. Common symptoms include depression, loss of identity and isolation. The rehabilitation process is slow and frustrating.</p>
        <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
        <h2>Literature Review</h2>
        <p class="read">The team had a rich background in psychology and thanks to their expertise we were able to assimilate a good number of popular literature available on the psychological well being of injured athletes. Initial survey also included some interviews with friends of the team members who have been through similar ordeal.</p>
        <h2>Survey</h2>

          <p class="read">
            Based on what we had discovered so far, we designed a survey to validate our assumptions and gain useful insights. We contacted multiple athlete groups in the University of Michigan to participate in the online survey on hosted on Surveycake.
          </p>
          <p class="read">
            Of the 87 athletes who had faced serious injury, 92% reported suffering from isolation and depression.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Interviewing the experts</h2>
        <p class="read">
          To get an overview of the process, we contacted some experts in the field. Interviews from physical therapist at the University of Michigan, mental coach and admin of popular Facbook groups dealing with well being of injured athletes gave us an overview of what athletes go through during the recovery period. We learnt that athhletes often do not complete the rehabilitation process.

        <h2>Interviewing the athletes</h2>
        <p class="read">Some of the participants of the online interview agreed to meet us for a face to face interview. An interview protocal was created based on expert interview and results from the survey. Their tales of injury and recovery gave helped us empathize with them and live the experience.</p>
        <p class="read">We learnt that they had a tough time keeping track of their rehabilitation process since it is slow and progress is hard to notice. Some athletes who had sufferred serious injuries had a tough time coping with the fact that they might not be able to participate for a very long time.</p>

        <h3>RESEARCH ANALYSIS</h3>
        <h2>Affinity wall</h2>
        
      </div>
      <div class="large-5 large-offset-2 cell">
        <p class="read">We created an affinity wall to discover trends from the information we had so faron an online whiteboard called realtimeboard. It allows real time collabration, has a simple UI and supports exporting in PDF. It was very easy to tag the notes and move them (as a group or individually) around the board.</p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p class="read">We found athletes at varying stages of recovery and varying severity of the injury. We decided to focus on two broad categories and made two personas to go with it.</p>
        <p class="read">
          <b>Tammy</b> is a junior and a captain of the college rugby team. During one of the pre season practice she sufferred from a ligament tear. She hopes to recover as soon as possible.
        </p>

        <p class="read">
          <b>Jason</b> is in the varsity rowing team. He was in a severe car crash a few months ago and is currently recovering. He has been unable to participate in training sessions since then. He has been recommended a lengthy rehabilitation process. He is very depressed and isolated and seems to be losing faith in the rehabilitation excercises as he cannot see his progress.
