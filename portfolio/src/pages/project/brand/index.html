		<p>Designing for yourself is a wonderful experience. There are high expectations and even more motivation. I started by sketching ideas for my logo, experimenting with the typography and designing the website.</p>

    <h2>Why K. ?</h2>

    <p>It’s common practice among some Indians to have the first letter of their father’s name as an initial.I was been known as K. Chetan all my life. until I applied for passport where they said that they cannot accept single letter initials. So I chose to use my father’s name as my last name, and now I am known as Chetan Keshav. The “K.” in the logo is a reminiscent of my life in India.</p>

    <h2>Web Development</h2>

    <p>This website was handcrafted. <a href="https://github.com/kchetan92/kchetan92.github.io">View the source code.</a></p>

    <h2>Process and Inspiration</h2>

    <p>I spent quite some time on websites like Medium, Dribbble, Behence and Pinterest to understand how designers portray their projects and portfolio. I got to witness some brilliant portfolios and I made a <a href="https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9J_k0fCYuE=/" target="_blank">moodboard</a> from all the interesting artworks that I found.</p>

    <p>My web design is inspired by the likes of Massimo Vignelli and <a href="https://www.swissted.com/" target="_blank">Swiss & German poster art</a> </p>

    <p>Here are some samples from my personal <a target="_blank" href="https://issuu.com/chetankeshav/docs/chetan_keshav_branding">brand guideline</a></p>
