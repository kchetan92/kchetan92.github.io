                    <p class="read">MiDojo is a networking app for professionals and students to seek mentorship. Mentorship is known to do wonders for one's career growth. From the initial research, I learned that most mentorship connections are made in the workplace, professional events, etc. This creates a rather tall barrier for people to approach each other. Even mentees are often confused about this relationship. If they expect a lot from the mentorship, the mentor will be unhappy. A steady loop of smart questions, feedback and results can work in their favor.</p>
                    
                    <p class="read">With MiDojo, I have tried to identify mentor and mentee’s pain points and emotions. I have then addressed these issues by proposing a social network dedicated to mentorship.</p>

But many potential mentors are often too busy to commit to regular meetings, or they have a hard time connecting with people seeking help. Design an experience where prospective mentors and mentees can be matched, based on similar interests, location, and availability. </p>

I have heard people talk about it on podcasts and write in lengths about it on their blog posts. I have had the opportunity of working with some fantastic designers and researchers over the past few years, and I have reached out to them in times of need. However, I had been apprehensive about finding mentors myself. For the sake of this project, I started with a blank slate, assuming I knew nothing about mentorship for career growth (well, there was a lot that I didn’t know). I also looked at mentorship without the UX lens. Mentorship is obviously, practiced in other professions as well.</p>
