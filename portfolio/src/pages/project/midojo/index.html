                    <p class="read">MiDojo is a networking app for professionals and students to seek mentorship. Such coaching can prove to be very positive for one’s performance. To learn more about this project, I did secondary research, talked to people who have mentored and those who have benefited from mentorship. Apart from friends and family, professionals who may not be directly related or close can be mentors too. But approaching such professionals is difficult due to negative personal experiences and social stigma that revolves around approaching unknown people for help. However, most such professionals are quite open to lending a helping hand.</p>
                    
                    <p class="read">With MiDojo, I have tried to identify mentor and mentee’s pain points and emotions. I have then addressed these issues by proposing a social network dedicated to mentorship.</p>

I have heard people talk about it on podcasts and write in lengths about it on their blog posts. I have had the opportunity of working with some fantastic designers and researchers over the past few years, and I have reached out to them in times of need. However, I had been apprehensive about finding mentors myself. For the sake of this project, I started with a blank slate, assuming I knew nothing about mentorship for career growth (well, there was a lot that I didn’t know). I also looked at mentorship without the UX lens. Mentorship is obviously, practiced in other professions as well.</p>
