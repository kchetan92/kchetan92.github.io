        <h2 class="name">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>GPS navigation has become a common place thanks to Google maps. We can now predict how to go from point A to B, even if its a new neighborhood. They now have maps for malls and airports as well.</p>

        <p>However, I am unhappy how the same interface is extended for pedestrians in a complex multi storey building.</p>

        <h2 class="name">Research</h2>
        <p>Some structures have an ill reputation for being confusing. There can be a variety of reasons for that. My college building is one of such structures. A semester later, I still get confused while finding my way to the meeting rooms.</p>

        <p>Some casual conversations revealed that I am not the only one who feels that way. But interviewing them “why or how” they feel about walking through a building did not reveal much information. Instead I asked them to draw a floor map of a building they frequent the most. Analyzing these pictures gave me an idea of what people observe and remember about their surroundings. Most of the participants missed the doors and hallways which they frequent.</p>

        <h2 class="name">Competitors</h2>
        <p><b>Google maps</b> is one of the most popular apps for vehicle navigation. Combined with the vast amount of data that Google has, they're your safest bet when exploring an unknown territory. The indoor maps feature in Google maps now features major structures such as airports and malls.</p>

          <p>Some other companies such as <a href="https://www.infsoft.com/" target="_blank">insoft</a>, <a href="https://www.accuware.com" target="_blank">accuware</a>, <a href="http://www.navvis.com/indoor-navigation" target="_blank">NavVis</a>, <a href="http://www.indooratlas.com/" target="_blank">IndoorAtlas</a>, use technology such as WiFi positions, bluetooth beacons, vision based navigation. Although these technologies overcome GPS's inaccuracy indoors, they're similar to Google Maps in terms of user experience.</p>

        <h2 class="name">Personas</h2>
        <p>Personas as a designing tool, allows the designer to pause for a moment and empathize with the demographic for whom he/she is designing for. The best personas are backed by research. However in case such research is not available, making up some personas greatly helps in the design process.</p>
