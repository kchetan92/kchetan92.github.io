		<div class="article-bg-image" style="background: url('{{root}}/assets/img/window.jpg')"></div>
		<p>Multistory buildings are a common place in modern towns and cities. Many of us leave our home in a multistory building to enter another for work. But building are complex and they feels like a different three dimensional maze, that one has to traverse to reach the exact office, room or exit. Intuition doesn’t always help in this case.</p>
		<p>There are no strict guidelines for naming room numbers in a building (confirmed from a student of architecture during my initial investigation) and it is difficult to do so owing to complex structure of buildings. Although maps and some signs are put up in corridors to allow people to navigate the complex, they don’t satisfactorily solve the issue.</p>
		<p>The ideal solution to this problem should not involve any personal device in form of an app or webpage since a newcomer may not have the recommended app or access to reliable internet connection inside the building. The solution should be inconspicuous and shouldn’t interfere with aesthetics of the interior design. The instructions provided to navigate the complex should be simple enough to remember. If a newcomer is asked to take the “3rd left from the 4th exit on the right side of the corridor” he is bound to forget the instructions or loose count. </p>
		<p>A possible solution to this problem would be to have small information panels in the corridors, where the user can enter / query the room number and activate small guiding lights along the path.</p>
