        <p class="read"><b>Methodology:</b> I interviewed some of my batchmates to find out about their experiences in navigating new building. I wanted to know what helps them search and recall their way through the structure.</p>

        <p class="read">Since people rely on intuition to find their way through a building, I couldn't get a complete picture through interviews alone.</p>

        <p class="read">I used a form of <b>cultural probe</b> to identify what people remember about a building. I asked them to draw a map of a floor which the frequent often.</p>
<!-- 
        <p class="read">Casual conversations revealed that I am not the only one who feels that way. But interviewing them “why or how” they feel about walking through a building did not reveal much information. Instead I asked them to draw a floor map of a building they frequent the most. Analyzing these pictures gave me an idea of what people observe and remember about their surroundings. Most of the participants missed the doors and hallways which they don't frequent.</p> -->
