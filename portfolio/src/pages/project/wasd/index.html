		<div class="article-bg-image" style="background: url('{{root}}/assets/img/hallway.jpg')"></div>
		<p>Most of my classes in UMSI takes place at North Quad in the central campus of the University of Michigan. With its beautiful exterior and secret passages and hallways, it resembles hogwarts. I have been here for a semester, and I am sometimes as clueless as the day I started taking classes here. This challenged me to rethink the experience of navigating a multistory building.</p>

		<p>GPS Technology and Google Maps has allowed us to predict how much time it can take to drive to a place, but I feel that navigating places inside a building is not a mature technology. In this project I explore how indoor navigation can be improvised. </p>

    <p>There are no strict guidelines for naming room numbers in a building (confirmed from a student of architecture during my initial investigation) and it is difficult to do so owing to complex structure of buildings. Although maps and some signs are put up in corridors to allow people to navigate the complex, they donâ€™t satisfactorily solve the issue.</p>

    <h2>Sketching</h2>

    <p>I sketched some ideas to start with. I did not limit myself to personal devices. Some of these ideas involve public gadgets.

    <h2>Experience Map</h2>

    <p>I conducted interviews to learn of how people manage to find their way in a new building. I got some insights into the problems that users were facing, but I realized that they were not able to express it very well. So, I conducted a test where I asked some people to go to a particular room or resource (printer or washroom) in a building as quickly as possible. They were not familiar with this building. I followed them and took notes as they made their way through the labyrinth of hallways.</p>

    <p>Based on my observations, I constructed the following experience map to help me with the paper prototype</p>

        <img src="{{root}}/assets/img/wasd/emotion_map.png" alt="">
      </a>
    </div>

    <h2>Paper prototype</h2>

                <div class="zoom-us Wallop-item" style="background-image: url('{{root}}/assets/img/wasd/paper_prototype_2.jpg')"></div>

          <div class="large-6 cell">
            <p>Once I had a general idea of what the app is expected to do, I made a paper prototype. It was a time consuming process, but user testing with this prototype gave me valuable feedback. I incorporated these learning in the final digital prototype.</p>

    <h2>Digital prototype</h2>

    <iframe style="transform: scale(1)" width="438" height="930" src="//invis.io/65F7U94HN" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>I wanted to keep the interface as close to the OS as possible as it makes it easy to use. Here I have used some elements from Android Material Design. Some design decisions were made to make the interface similar to Google Maps, as a majority of users are already familiar with its interface.
