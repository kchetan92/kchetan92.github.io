          <p class="read">This was my first ubiquitous computing project. Good user research practices can be applied to many areas and the end result need not be a mobile or a desktop interface. Brushybuddy is a tool aimed at young children to teach them good brushing behavior. The challenge was to design a tool which was easy to use and wouldn’t obstruct the regular brushing process and still be enjoyable, motivating and easy to understand.</p>
          
          <p class="read">Ubiquitous computing strives to keep the human computer interaction to a minimum. An ideal ubiquitous computing system blends into the environment and uses the users’ natural movement as input. We incorporated sensors in the toothbrush, and used the feedback from the movement of the toothbrush to drive the system. This was easy for any child to operate.</p>

The lights on the toothbrush holders indicate the areas the kids need to brush. There’s a sensor in the toothbrush that can sense if the kid is brushing in the right way (circle/direction: up and down/) and if the kids fully cleaned this area. If you are doing wrong, the toothbrush holder will remind the kid to brush the teeth correctly and the competitor will exceed the kid.</p>

          <p class="read">Parents feel that they must teach kids how to brush their teeth. Therefore they do not want a tool to replace their tutoring function entirely. However, parents do hope that some tool could be in place to help kids brush their teeth correctly when they are busy or not in a good mood (e.g., in a busy morning).</p>

          </p>
          <p class="read">Kids (3-5) cannot be pushed too hard in learning the correct tooth brushing behavior. Based on their ability as a very young kid, they cannot do the brushing movements very agilely, and we cannot ask them for 100% correct. It would discourage kids, and make them frustrated. It would be better to focus on the long-term goal by teaching the kid gradually and step by step.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="read">It will be distracting if we use mirror and toothbrush holder at the same time to show visual instructions (like the game prototype we did) since kids need to look up to see the mirror and then look down to see the toothbrush. Displaying visual instructions on the mirror is the most natural way to incorporate the smart device into the toothbrushing experience.</p>

          <p class="read">Based on our learnings from the user enactment, we concluded that we should not take the responsibility of teaching kids how to brush from their parents. The device should only promote, verify and report/record the brushing behavior. We also noticed that the toothbrush should not be too distracting; otherwise children will lose interest from the brushing exercise.</p>
          
          <p class="read">We propose to solve this issue by using interactions in the smart mirror. The interactions on the mirror will not distract the user from brushing. It will also monitor their progress and motivate them with fun visualization of their brushing progress. (i.e. the brushed areas turning from yellow to white, and the artificial germs disappear gradually.)</p>
          
          <p class="read">The parent will be able to monitor the children’s progress by using a companion app. With video tutorials, the  app is able to show users how to brush in a correct way. From our research, we found that more often than not, parents are not 100% sure about the brushing skills. In this case,  the app could serve as a good helper to parents.</p>
          
          <p class="read">The toothbrush assembly consists of a gyroscope and accelerometer sensor. The yaw, pith and roll value of the toothbrush is gathered from this sensor as the user brush their teeth. One of the limitations of using this approach is that we have to ask the user to hold the toothbrush still in front of their mouth to allow the sensor to calibrate the starting position. The subsequent positions calculated are relative to the initial position. The sensor data is sent to a server via serial communication over a bluetooth module.</p>
          
          <p class="read">We use Origami Studio to build the display for the mirror that gets the data from the server where we upload the data from the sensor. In Origami, we make the screen display the representative visuals that we made with Google Poly 3D models by translating the integer data into the corresponding area of the mouth. During the tooth brushing process, the screen display gets data from the server every second and changes the visual to display the specific area as the angle of the toothbrush changes.</p>
