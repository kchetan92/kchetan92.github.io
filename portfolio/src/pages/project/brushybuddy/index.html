          <p class="read">This was my first ubiquitous computing project. Good user research practices can be applied to many areas and the end result need not be a mobile or a desktop interface. Brushybuddy is a tool aimed at young children to teach them good brushing behavior. The challenge was to design a tool which was easy to use and wouldn’t obstruct the regular brushing process and still be enjoyable, motivating and easy to understand.</p>

          <p class="read">I also got to work with numerous sensors and use the data to create a working prototype of the solution. --imp--</p>

There’s a sensor in the toothbrush that can sense if the kid is brushing in the right way (circle/direction: up and down/) and if the kids fully cleaned this area. If you are doing wrong, the toothbrush holder will remind the kid to brush the teeth correctly and the competitor will exceed the kid.</p>

However, parents do hope that some tool could be in place to help kids brush their teeth correctly when they are busy or not in a good mood (e.g., in a busy morning).</p>

          </p>
          <p class="read">Kids (3-5) cannot be pushed too hard in learning the correct tooth brushing behavior. Based on their ability as a very young kid, they cannot do the brushing movements very agilely, and we cannot ask them for 100% correct. It would discourage kids, and make them frustrated. It would be better to focus on the long-term goal by teaching the kid gradually and step by step.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="read">It will be distracting if we use mirror and toothbrush holder at the same time to show visual instructions (like the game prototype we did) since kids need to look up to see the mirror and then look down to see the toothbrush. Displaying visual instructions on the mirror is the most natural way to incorporate the smart device into the toothbrushing experience.</p>
