              <p class="read">This was my first ubiquitous computing project. Good user research practices can be applied to many areas and the end result need not be a mobile or a desktop interface. Brushybuddy is a tool aimed at young children to teach them good brushing behavior. The challenge was to design a tool which was easy to use and wouldn’t obstruct the regular brushing process and still be enjoyable, motivating and easy to understand.</p>
              
              <p class="read">Ubiquitous computing strives to keep the human-computer interaction to a minimum. An ideal ubiquitous computing system blends into the environment and uses the users’ natural movement as input. We incorporated sensors in the toothbrush and used the feedback from the movement of the toothbrush to drive the system. This interaction was easy for any child to operate.</p>

              </p>
              <p class="read">Parents feel that they <span class="bold">must teach kids</span> how to brush their teeth. Therefore they do not want a device to replace their tutoring function entirely. However, parents do hope that some tool could be in place to help kids brush their teeth correctly when they are <span class="bold">busy or not in a good mood</span> (e.g., in a busy morning).</p>

              </p>
              <p class="read">Kids (3-5) cannot be pushed too hard in learning the correct tooth brushing behavior. Based on their ability as a very young kid, they cannot do the brushing movements very quickly, and we cannot expect them to be correct all the time. This would discourage kids, and frustrate them. It would be better to focus on the long-term goal by <span class="bold">teaching the kid gradually and step by step.</span></p>

              <p class="read">It will be distracting if we use mirror and toothbrush holder at the same time to show visual instructions (like the game prototype we did) since kids need to look up to see the mirror and then look down to see the toothbrush. <span class="bold">Displaying visual instructions on the mirror is the most natural</span> way to incorporate the smart device into the toothbrushing experience.</p>

                <p class="read">Based on our findings from the user enactment, we concluded that parents should be involved in this process of educating the children and the solution should not distract the user much from the primary brushing activity.</p>
                
                <p class="read">We propose BrushyBuddy, a friendly mascot which guides the children how to brush. The mascot is displayed behind a two-way mirror so that the child is not distracted. The sensors on the brush predict the position of the brush and send the data over Bluetooth to the mascot. The mascot ensures that all the regions of the mouth are brushed well and for long enough. This data is also sent to the parents’ mobile app for them to look at the daily or weekly brushing logs.</p>
