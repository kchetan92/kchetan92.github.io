              <p class="read">Dental hygiene is a major concern for new parents. They are often not well informed in dental health and can pass on bad habits to their children. The children’s eating habits vastly differ from adults and are more prone to dental problems. To add to this problem, parents are busy and do have time to supervise brushing all the time.</p>
              
              <p class="read">We developed BrushyBuddy to tackle this problem. It is built on the principles of ubiquitous design and is very easy to use and learn for children. The product was thoroughly researched, tested and built using sensors and micro-controllers.</p>

The mascot ensures that all the regions of the mouth are brushed well and for long enough. This data is also sent to the parents’ mobile app for them to look at the daily or weekly brushing logs.</p>
