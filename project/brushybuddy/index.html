Based on their ability as a very young kid, they cannot do the brushing movements very agilely, and we cannot ask them for 100% correct. It would discourage kids, and make them frustrated.

              <p class="read">Based on our learnings from the user enactment, we concluded that we should not take the responsibility of teaching kids how to brush from their parents. The device should only promote, verify and report/record the brushing behavior. We also noticed that the toothbrush should not be too distracting; otherwise children will lose interest from the brushing exercise.</p>
    
              <p class="read">We propose to solve this issue by using interactions in the smart mirror. The interactions on the mirror will not distract the user from brushing. It will also monitor their progress and motivate them with fun visualization of their brushing progress. (i.e. the brushed areas turning from yellow to white, and the artificial germs disappear gradually.)</p>
    
              <p class="read">The parent will be able to monitor the children’s progress by using a companion app. With video tutorials, the  app is able to show users how to brush in a correct way. From our research, we found that more often than not, parents are not 100% sure about the brushing skills. In this case,  the app could serve as a good helper to parents.</p>
    
              <p class="read">The toothbrush assembly consists of a gyroscope and accelerometer sensor. The yaw, pith and roll value of the toothbrush is gathered from this sensor as the user brush their teeth. One of the limitations of using this approach is that we have to ask the user to hold the toothbrush still in front of their mouth to allow the sensor to calibrate the starting position. The subsequent positions calculated are relative to the initial position. The sensor data is sent to a server via serial communication over a bluetooth module.</p>
    
              <p class="read">We use Origami Studio to build the display for the mirror that gets the data from the server where we upload the data from the sensor. In Origami, we make the screen display the representative visuals that we made with Google Poly 3D models by translating the integer data into the corresponding area of the mouth. During the tooth brushing process, the screen display gets data from the server every second and changes the visual to display the specific area as the angle of the toothbrush changes.</p>
