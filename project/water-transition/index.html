        <p>Ms. Katy was left in the lurch today when she arrived at her rental apartment in Ann Arbor where she is planning to stay for the duration of this school year. Upon arriving at the independent house which is only a mile away from the central campus of the University of Michigan, she discovered that there is no running water! Upon contacting the landlord, she learned that she has to formally accept the ownership of the water connection by contacting the City Works Department before she can get water in the apartment. A practice, relatively unknown in other parts of the country.</p>
    
        <p>To her misfortune today is Friday and the city will only be able to act on her request and switch on the water connection on Monday. Without running water this seemingly picturesque and peaceful house is uninhabitable. She is currently looking for alternate arrangements in a hotel for the weekend, which will inevitably disturb her finances.</p>
    
        <p>On the other side of the city at the City Works Department, Ms. Augelia could be seen glued to her desk all day. She is one of a small and diligent group of customer care executive at the City Works Department who will answer around 2300 calls this month to answer queries related to Water Connections. This season has historically been hectic for Ms. Augelia. Ann Arbor is a college town with a population of 120,782 out of which around 40,000 are students at the University of Michigan who move in and out of their rented properties this month. And a large number of these students have queries about the water connection.</p>
    
        <p>As a part of a class project, we chose to assist the city and find a suitable solution to alleviate this problem.</p>
    
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
    
        <div class="Wallop Wallop--fade" autoplay="2500">
          <div class="image-paper-prototype half-width Wallop-list">
            <div class="Wallop-item" style="background-image: url('../..//assets/img/water/affinity-1.jpg')"></div>
            <div class="Wallop-item" style="background-image: url('../..//assets/img/water/affinity-2.jpg')"></div>

        <p>We started with an initial meeting with the team members to come to a common understanding of the roles and responsibilities. We then arranged an initial meeting with the client to develop relations, discuss the problem statement, learn some critical facts, set expectations, discuss a rough timeline and schedule interviews with personnel involved in the process.</p>
    
        <p>Meanwhile we dug up everything we could find about the problem as a part of our background research. We called other college towns to see how they handle the water transition issue, explored the technology available which can be helpful in this case and understood the legislation process of the city council to ensure that our suggestions aren’t outlandish to implement.</p>
    
        <p>A well-thought interview protocol was developed before interviewing the various people involved in the process. Each interview was transcribed by hand in the presence of other members of the team. This process took days together, but we noticed that transcribing gives a lot more information than the interview notes that we could’ve missed otherwise.</p>
    
        <p>After taking more than ten interviews with the city works personnel, tenants and owners we collected around 400 independent interview notes. We played Sherlock and used these notes to build an affinity wall to understand the major themes of the issue, hoping to come up with concrete facts to base our recommendations. This process was time-consuming, but it allowed us to identify very well defined patterns.</p>
